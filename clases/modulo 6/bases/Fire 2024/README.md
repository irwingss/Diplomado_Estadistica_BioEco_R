•           Summary of experimental efforts underlying this dataset

The datasets included here are from the Gorongosa Savanna Ecology Experiment, a factorial experiment exploring interactions between fire (cold and hot burns and plots without fire) and large mammals (exclosure vs. open plots).  All methods are described in the uploaded methods and in the article, Ecosystem-wide responses to fire and large mammal herbivores in an African savanna, in Biotropica.

•           Description of file structure and contents

Files are Excel files.  One worksheet contains the data, organized and ready for analyses, and the second worksheet (titled ‘explanation’) describes the variables in each column of the data worksheets.

•           Definitions of all variables, abbreviations, missing data codes, and units

All descriptions are in the ‘explanation’ worksheets of the Excel files.  The only exception is the phenolics dataset in which the column names are self-explanatory.  Cells with “NA” lacked data.
